# install-sof-ipc4-fix.sh — fetch the running kernel's sound/soc/sof tree
# from the upstream stable tree, apply Peter Ujfalusi's IPC4 copier-payload
# refresh patch (thesofproject/linux PR #5762), build snd-sof.ko out-of-tree
# against the installed kernel headers, and drop the resulting
# snd-sof.ko.zst into the modules `updates/` overlay so it loads instead of
# the unpatched in-tree module.
#
# Background:
#   On Panther Lake (and other Intel SOF platforms), the IPC4 ipc_config_data
#   buffer for copier widgets is built once during ipc_prepare and cached.
#   On suspend/resume, host and link DMA streams are released and re-allocated
#   with potentially different stream tags, but because the widget list
#   persists across suspend, sof_pcm_hw_params skips
#   sof_pcm_setup_connected_widgets and ipc_prepare never runs again. The
#   stale cached payload is then sent to firmware with boot-time DMA channel
#   assignments → DMA channel conflicts → firmware panic and dead audio.
#
#   This is the documented root cause behind thesofproject/sof#10700
#   "Dell XPS 14 DA14260 (Panther Lake): DSP error when unsuspending".
#
#   On the specific HONOR ZQC-P unit this repo was developed on, the
#   upstream race did NOT reproduce: a pavucontrol + rtcwake -m mem -s 8
#   ×3 cycle test produced zero `DSP panic!` entries in `dmesg`, and
#   the six boots logged in the local journal also contain zero. We
#   ship the backport anyway as a preventive measure — the upstream
#   fix is a clean one-file patch from the SOF maintainer, and the
#   workflow that triggers the race is application-driven (which
#   PipeWire / pavucontrol versions, when streams are open at the
#   moment of suspend, etc.), so it may surface here later.
#
#   The honor-fnf7-watch.service in this repo counts EVERY transition
#   of /sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_state. Many of those are part of the
#   runtime PM D3 cycle (kernel transiently flags fw_state=CRASHED
#   when an IPC drops during D3 entry, then auto-recovers to
#   NOT_STARTED). They are NOT the same as the firmware-reported DSP
#   panic from upstream #10700 and should NOT be used to estimate
#   the rate of real firmware crashes.
#
#   The fix refreshes copier_data (and for DAI copiers, the dma_config_tlv
#   trailer) in ipc_config_data inside sof_ipc4_widget_setup right before
#   the IPC message is sent. Touches one file:
#     sound/soc/sof/ipc4-topology.c   (+33 lines)
#
# This is a workaround for as long as the upstream patch under
# patch/sof-audio/0001-ASoC-SOF-ipc4-topology-Refresh-copier-IPC-payload-before-widget-setup.patch
# has not yet landed in the kernel being used. Once the change is in the
# running kernel's ipc4-topology.c this script becomes a no-op (it will
# detect the existing edit and skip the rebuild, removing any stale overlay).
#
# Reruns are safe — running it after a kernel update will rebuild against
# the new headers automatically.

  SOF IPC4 copier-payload refresh installed.

  Overlay: $KO_OVERLAY
  Backup of original in-tree module: $BACKUP
  (delete the overlay file and re-run depmod to revert.)

  After REBOOT the patched snd-sof.ko will load instead of the in-tree
  one. The fix prevents the stale-DMA-channel race that crashes the
  Panther Lake DSP firmware on suspend/resume — see
  thesofproject/sof#10700 for the upstream tracking issue.

  Direct repro from the upstream issue (to validate the fix):
    open pavucontrol, leave it running, then
    \$ sudo rtcwake -m mem -s 5
    repeat 2-3 times. With this fix in place, the DSP must NOT panic
    (check journalctl -k -b | grep -i 'sof' for clean output).

  The reliable metric for "is the patch doing anything visible" is the
  count of firmware-reported panics in the journal:
    \$ journalctl -b 0 -k | grep -c 'DSP panic'
  This should stay at 0. The CRASHED count in
  /var/log/honor-fnf7-watch.log is NOT a reliable indicator — it
  conflates firmware panics with benign runtime PM D3 transitions.

  Re-run this script after every kernel update to keep the fix.

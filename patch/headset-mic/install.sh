# Apply our quirk.
#
# We do NOT use the simple ALC2XX_FIXUP_HEADSET_MIC the way BRB-X M1010
# does. That fixup's pincfg `0x03a1103c` has JACK_DETECT_OVERRIDE=0
# (use the codec's real impedance detection) and only handles
# HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE — it never invokes the codec's headset-mode
# probe/init paths. On the ZQC-P PCB this leaves pin 0x19 in a state
# where GET_PIN_SENSE returns 0 after boot/suspend until the user
# physically unplugs and replugs the jack: the SOF DSP capture pathway
# is never activated and recording from `pcm0c HDA Analog` is silent.
#
# Instead we add a new fixup `ALC256_FIXUP_HONOR_ZQC_P_M1010_MIC` that:
#   1. Sets pin 0x19 to `0x01a1913c` (JACK_DETECT_OVERRIDE=1, "always
#      present, ignore the impedance circuit"); same pattern many other
#      Realtek/HONOR/Dell quirks use ("use as headset mic, without its
#      own jack detect"). This bypasses the unreliable hardware detect
#      on this PCB.
#   2. Chains to `ALC269_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE_NO_HP_MIC`. That existing
#      kernel fixup calls `alc_fixup_headset_mode_no_hp_mic` →
#      `alc_fixup_headset_mode` which handles PRE_PROBE (parse flag),
#      PROBE (`alc_probe_headset_mode`) AND INIT
#      (`alc_update_headset_mode`, run on every codec init including
#      after S3/S4 resume). This is the piece our previous one-line
#      patch was missing.
#
# After this fixup the headset mic works out of the box across cold
# boot, warm reboot and suspend/resume cycles, with no need for any
# userspace daemon or hda-verb tricks.

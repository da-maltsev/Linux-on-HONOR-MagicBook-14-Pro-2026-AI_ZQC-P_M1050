# HONOR MagicBook Pro 14 AI (ZQC-P, M1010) — Linux fixes

Everything needed to make this laptop usable under Linux: a patched ACPI table,
a HID descriptor fixup, three small kernel/userspace patches, and a fan sensor
module. Each fix lives in its own directory under [`patch/`](patch/) with its
own README, measurements, and installer.

> **This fork** targets the **Ultra 5 338H** SKU with the **M1050** DMI
> revision (`product_version` = M1050; upstream's unit was an Ultra X9 388H
> with M1010) and stock Arch / Omarchy (the original was developed on CachyOS).
> Changes:
> * [`patch/fingerprint-egismoc/`](patch/fingerprint-egismoc/) — the 338H SKU
>   ships an Egis/LighTuning `1c7a:05aa` (EgisTec ET171) reader instead of the
>   Goodix `27c6:6f94` the Ultra 7/9 units carry. The ET171 is SDCP-gated and
>   STALLs on the vendor control-init every other egismoc sensor accepts, so it
>   needs a per-sensor init skip on top of the SDCP-capable build — a port of
>   drphilth/honor-fmbp-libfprint-sdcp, **hardware-verified on this unit**.
>   `apply_patch.sh` detects the reader at step [13/14] and runs the matching
>   installer.
> * Omarchy boots a UKI via `limine-mkinitcpio`, and its `omarchy_hooks.conf`
>   drop-in overrides the base `HOOKS=`. The original script edited
>   `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` (which the drop-in ignores), so the ACPI override
>   never reached the boot image and the touchpad stayed dead. `apply_patch.sh`
>   now patches the drop-ins too and verifies the SSDT landed in the UKI.
> * `headset-mic`, `sof-audio` and `cdclk-ptl` no longer assume a clang-built
>   kernel or a CachyOS-style release string; they detect the toolchain and
>   sync `EXTRAVERSION` from the running kernel's Makefile.

## Status

| Area | State | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Touchpad, touchscreen, internal keyboard | works | [`patch/acpi-override/`](patch/acpi-override/) — patched SSDT27 plus `i8042.dumbkbd=1`. **Prerequisite for a usable machine** |
| Microphone mutes itself, mic-mute LED flickers | works | [`patch/micmute/`](patch/micmute/) — HID-BPF fixup for the touchscreen's vendor collection |
| Fingerprint reader, Goodix `27c6:6f94` | works | [`patch/fingerprint/`](patch/fingerprint/) — two-line `libfprint` id patch |
| Fingerprint reader, EgisTec `1c7a:05aa` (Ultra 5 338H) | works | [`patch/fingerprint-egismoc/`](patch/fingerprint-egismoc/) — SDCP-capable `libfprint` build (`feature/sdcp-v2` + init skip), hardware-verified on this unit |
| Headset microphone, 3.5 mm jack | works | [`patch/headset-mic/`](patch/headset-mic/) — one-line `SND_PCI_QUIRK` for ALC256 |
| OLED minimum brightness too low, uneven steps | works | [`patch/oled-backlight/`](patch/oled-backlight/) — patched VBT raises the firmware's backlight floor |
| Touchpad left-edge slide (brightness gesture) | works | [`patch/touchpad-edge/`](patch/touchpad-edge/) — HID-BPF turns the vendor gesture report into brightness keys. The right edge (volume) goes through the EC and works unaided |
| Screen garbled at boot, kernel 7.1.6 and newer | works, opt-in | [`patch/cdclk-ptl/`](patch/cdclk-ptl/) — rebuilds `xe.ko` with the upstream CDCLK fix that Panther Lake needs and that is not merged yet |
| Fan RPM readout | works | [`patch/fan/`](patch/fan/) — `honor-zqcp-hwmon` |
| Fan control | not available | the EC owns the fan curve and ignores every OS-side path, see [`patch/fan/README.md`](patch/fan/README.md) |
| SOF DSP suspend/resume panic | preventive | [`patch/sof-audio/`](patch/sof-audio/) — upstream IPC4 backport, the race never reproduced here |
| Fixes reverted by package updates | handled | [`patch/auto-rebuild/`](patch/auto-rebuild/) — pacman hooks that rebuild them |
| Caps Lock LED | dark | collateral of `i8042.dumbkbd=1`; an upstream `atkbd` quirk removes both, see [`patch/keyboard-atkbd/`](patch/keyboard-atkbd/) |
| Fn+F7 mic-mute key itself | works out of the box | in-tree `huawei-wmi`, nothing to install |

Speakers, headphone output, the built-in DMIC array, webcam, Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth all work with no changes.

## Device

| | |
|---|---|
| **Manufacturer** | HONOR |
| **Product name** | ZQC-P |
| **Marketing name** | HONOR MagicBook Pro 14 AI (2026) |
| **DMI version** | M1010 |
| **CPU** | Intel® Core™ Ultra X9 388H ("Panther Lake") |
| **PCH GPIO ID** | `INTC10BC` (five communities, gpiochip0..4) |
| **BIOS** | HONOR 1.10 (2026-06-03) |
| **Panel** | EDO 14.55" OLED, 3120x2080 at 120 Hz, backlight on native PWM at 200 Hz |
| **Touchpad** | Goodix **TOPS0102** on `\_SB.PC00.I2C1.TPD0` (I²C HID, addr `0x5D`) |
| **Touchscreen** | FocalTech **FTSC1000** on `\_SB.PC00.I2C2.TPL1` (I²C HID) |
| **Fingerprint** | Goodix USB `27c6:6f94` — works with a two-line `libfprint` patch, see [`patch/fingerprint/`](patch/fingerprint/) |
| **Fingerprint (Ultra 5 338H SKU)** | EgisTec/LighTuning USB `1c7a:05aa` (ET171) — SDCP-gated, needs the build in [`patch/fingerprint-egismoc/`](patch/fingerprint-egismoc/) |
| **Webcam (built-in)** | Shinetech FHD over USB (`3277:00de`) — works out of the box |

Both touch devices are advertised in firmware with `_HID/_CID = PNP0C50`
(Microsoft HID-over-I²C), so the in-kernel `i2c-hid-acpi` driver is the
correct binding — there is no need for a vendor-specific driver.

---

## Tested environment

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | CachyOS (Arch-based, rolling) |
| Kernel | `linux-cachyos 7.1.5-1`, earlier work on 7.0.x and `linux-cachyos-lts 6.18.31-1` |
| initramfs | `mkinitcpio 41-x` |
| Bootloader | `limine 11.x` with `limine-mkinitcpio-hook` |
| Desktop | GNOME 50 on Wayland, PipeWire 1.6.6 |

Kernel requirements: `CONFIG_ACPI_TABLE_UPGRADE=y` and
`CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_ACPI_TABLE_UPGRADE=y` for the ACPI override, `CONFIG_HID_BPF=y`
and `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y` for the mic-mute fixup. Anything from 6.10 on
qualifies. Other bootloaders work, see [Other bootloaders](#other-bootloaders).

The same patches should apply to any HONOR ZQC-P/M1010 unit regardless of
distro, as long as the kernel supports initrd ACPI table overrides and you have
a way to put the patched SSDT into an *early*, uncompressed CPIO.

---

## Installing

```bash
git clone <this-repo> HONOR_ZQC-P_M1010
cd HONOR_ZQC-P_M1010
sudo ./apply_patch.sh
sudo reboot
```

That is the whole thing. `apply_patch.sh` installs every fix in this
repository, is idempotent, and backs up everything it replaces into a
timestamped directory it prints at the end. `uninstall_patch.sh` reverts it.

Every step after the ACPI override is independent and only warns on failure,
so a step that cannot build never blocks the rest.

Optional steps can be turned off, and the backlight floor can be overridden:

```bash
sudo SKIP_FINGERPRINT=1 ./apply_patch.sh     # skip the slowest step
sudo VBT_MIN=10 ./apply_patch.sh             # a different backlight floor
```

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SKIP_OLED=1` | leave the OLED backlight floor at the firmware value |
| `SKIP_EDGE=1` | leave the touchpad left-edge brightness gesture dead |
| `SKIP_FAN=1` | no fan RPM readout |
| `SKIP_FINGERPRINT=1` | no `libfprint` rebuild, by far the slowest step |
| `VBT_MIN=<n>` | backlight floor in n/255, default 12. Measure yours first with `patch/oled-backlight/measure-floor.sh` |
| `WITH_CDCLK=1` | rebuild `xe.ko` with the Panther Lake cdclk fix. Off by default: it downloads the distro kernel source, about 260 MB, and compiles for a few minutes |
| `GUARD_ZERO=1` | add a udev rule that bounces a write of `0` to the backlight back to `1`. Writing 0 blanks the panel rather than dimming it, and no VBT value can prevent that. Off by default |

Each fix also has its own installer, if you would rather apply one on its own:

```bash
sudo bash patch/touchpad-edge/install.sh
```

### What `apply_patch.sh` does

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Backs up everything about to be touched |
| 2 | Installs `patch/acpi-override/SSDT27_TPD0.aml` into `/usr/lib/firmware/acpi/` and the `acpi_override` mkinitcpio hook |
| 3 | Adds `acpi_override` to `HOOKS=` in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, right after `autodetect` |
| 4 | Appends `i8042.dumbkbd=1` to the kernel cmdline in `/etc/default/limine` |
| 5 | Runs `patch/oled-backlight/install.sh` — patched VBT, `FILES=` entry and `xe.vbt_firmware=` on the cmdline |
| 6 | Runs `patch/cdclk-ptl/install.sh` — rebuilds `xe.ko` with the Panther Lake cdclk fix, into the `updates/` overlay. Only with `WITH_CDCLK=1` |
| 7 | Regenerates the initramfs and the bootloader config, once, after all the config edits |
| 8 | Runs `patch/headset-mic/install.sh` — rebuilds `snd-hda-codec-alc269.ko` with the ALC256 quirk for PCI SSID `1ee7:209d` |
| 9 | Runs `patch/sof-audio/install.sh` — builds `snd-sof.ko` with the IPC4 backport into the `updates/` overlay |
| 10 | Runs `patch/micmute/install.sh` — builds and installs the HID-BPF descriptor fixup through `udev-hid-bpf` |
| 11 | Runs `patch/touchpad-edge/install.sh` — HID-BPF program for the left-edge brightness gesture |
| 12 | Runs `patch/fan/install.sh` — `honor-zqcp-hwmon`, EC fan tachometers, through DKMS |
| 13 | Runs `patch/fingerprint/install.sh` or `patch/fingerprint-egismoc/install.sh` depending on the reader — rebuilds `libfprint` with the Goodix `27c6:6f94` id, or installs the SDCP-capable build for the EgisTec ET171 `1c7a:05aa` |
| 14 | Runs `patch/auto-rebuild/install.sh` — pacman hooks that keep steps 8, 9 and 13 applied across package updates (the Egis build is a separate package, so the hook exits early once it is installed) |

Steps 8 and 9 are skipped with a warning if kernel lockdown or
`module.sig_enforce=1` would block an unsigned module. Steps 13 and 14 are
skipped on non-pacman systems. Step 6 runs before the initramfs rebuild
because the early-KMS copy of `xe.ko` is the one that lights the panel.

### Verifying after reboot

```bash
# ACPI override loaded, no AE_AML_INTERNAL
sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'I2C_DEVT|table upgrade'

# both touch controllers enumerated
ls /sys/bus/acpi/devices/ | grep -iE 'TOPS|FTSC'
sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'i2c.hid|hid-multitouch'

# keyboard quirk on the cmdline
grep -o 'i8042.dumbkbd=1' /proc/cmdline

# no phantom KEY_MICMUTE device — must print nothing
grep -l UNKNOWN /sys/class/input/input*/name | xargs -r grep -H 2808

# the HID-BPF fixup is loaded
sudo udev-hid-bpf list-loaded

# ALC256 quirk picked up
sudo dmesg | grep 'picked fixup.*1ee7:209d'

# fan RPM readout
sensors | grep -A3 honor_zqcp

# fingerprint reader usable (Egis 1c7a:05aa or Goodix 27c6:6f94)
fprintd-list "$USER"
```

### Surviving package updates

Both kernel-module fixes install into `/usr/lib/modules/$KVER/updates/`, which
`depmod` searches before `kernel/`, so a package update never overwrites them.
What it does do is produce a *new* kernel that has no `updates/` entry yet. The
pacman hooks from step 9 fill that in automatically, and re-apply the
fingerprint patch after a libfprint update.

Everything else needs nothing: the ACPI override is firmware data, the HID-BPF
object is CO-RE, and the fan module uses DKMS.

Check what happened after an update:

```bash
sudo tail -40 /var/log/honor-zqcp-autorebuild.log
```

Details and the manual fallback are in
[`patch/auto-rebuild/README.md`](patch/auto-rebuild/README.md).

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Cause |
|---|---|
| **Caps Lock LED stays dark** | `i8042.dumbkbd=1`, needed for the internal keyboard, also disables atkbd's `SET_LEDS` path, so the keyboard comes up without `EV_LED`. An upstream `atkbd` DMI quirk fixes the keyboard without the parameter and brings the LED back; verified on this unit, waiting to be merged. See [`patch/keyboard-atkbd/`](patch/keyboard-atkbd/) |
| **Fan control is not possible** | the EC owns the fan curve. `SFNS` is gated on an `MFGM` flag no AML path ever sets, and the DPTF `TFN1` cooling device accepts writes that the EC ignores. Both tested, see [`patch/fan/README.md`](patch/fan/README.md) |
| **Mic-mute LED follows the built-in array only** | the kernel's control-LED group tracks `Dmic0 Capture Switch` and lights the LED only when *every* attached control is muted. Mute the 3.5 mm jack input while it is not the default and the LED does not move. The built-in array is the default, so Fn+F7 works normally. See [`patch/headset-mic/README.md`](patch/headset-mic/README.md) |
| **Brightness steps are not perceptually uniform** | the desktop divides `max_brightness` linearly, 20 steps of 5% on this panel, so the first step changes the light output far more than the rest. [`patch/oled-backlight/`](patch/oled-backlight/) removes the worst of it by raising the floor, but a perceptual curve has to come from the desktop, and PowerDevil rejected one by design |
| **The very dim end is not usable** | this OLED does not render its firmware-declared minimum evenly. Raising the floor trades the darkest settings for an even image; there is no setting that gives both |
| **200 Hz backlight PWM above roughly 15% brightness** | the panel's own 4320 Hz dimming, which HONOR advertises as flicker free, only runs at low brightness. Above it the 200 Hz envelope from the SoC is all that remains, and it cannot be changed: the driver takes the PWM period from the `BXT_BLC_PWM_FREQ` register the BIOS programmed, consulting the VBT frequency field only when that register reads zero |
| **MIPI / IPU6 cameras unconfigured** | no sensor on this SKU |
| **NFC unusable** | the `NTAG0001` controller sits on I²C-1 and Linux has no driver for it |
| **Some OEM helper ACPI devices disabled** | `INTC10CC` HID Discovery, `INTC10DF` TSE and similar are disabled by firmware and are not needed for any user-visible function |

### Recovering the Caps Lock LED

Caps Lock itself works correctly as a modifier; only the LED is dark. If you
want to try getting it back:

1. Reboot. At the Limine menu, press `e` on the kernel entry.
2. In the `cmdline:` line, strip ` i8042.dumbkbd=1`.
3. Boot (F10 or Enter). Plug in an external USB keyboard first as a
   fallback in case the internal one misbehaves.
4. Use the internal keyboard for a few minutes. If you see no key
   repeats, no dropouts, and Caps Lock LED works — the quirk is no
   longer needed on your firmware revision; remove the parameter from
   `/etc/default/limine` permanently. If you do see misbehaviour, try
   replacing `i8042.dumbkbd=1` with `i8042.nomux=1` (a softer quirk
   that disables only mux probing, leaving the LED path intact). If
   neither works, keep `i8042.dumbkbd=1` — Caps Lock LED stays as
   collateral damage of the keyboard fix.

There is no EC-side Caps Lock LED field in this BIOS (none of `CAPL`,
`CAPS`, `CapsLed`, `KBLE` appear in the disassembled DSDT), so the LED
is keyboard-internal and only the PS/2 `SET_LEDS` command can drive it.

---

## Cooling and fan behaviour

The fans work, but they engage far later than they do on Windows with HONOR PC
Manager. This is EC firmware behaviour and is not something this repo fixes.

| EC-CPU temp | fan 0 | fan 1 | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 49 °C, idle from a cold boot | 0 | 0 | genuinely stopped |
| 51-68 °C | 0 | 0 | still stopped, load already ramping |
| **72 °C** | **2355** | **1913** | **engagement point** |
| 84 °C | 2455 | 2373 | |
| 89 °C | 3656 | 3276 | clearly audible |

Two things surprise people: the fans are completely off at idle, and there is a
long spin-down hysteresis, so a non-zero reading at low temperature usually
means "recently under load" rather than "idle speed".

RPM readout is solved by `honor-zqcp-hwmon`. Control is not available. The full
measurements, the EC register map, and every control path that was tested and
failed are in [`patch/fan/README.md`](patch/fan/README.md).

---

## How the patch is built

`patch/acpi-override/SSDT27_TPD0.aml` is regenerated from `patch/acpi-override/SSDT27_TPD0.dsl` with:

```bash
build/build_patch.sh
```

The script

1. Runs `iasl SSDT27_TPD0.dsl` to produce a fresh AML.
2. Patches the OEM-revision field in the AML header from `0x00001000` (the
   OEM value) to `0x00002000` — Linux only swaps an existing SSDT for an
   initrd-provided one when **all** of `signature` / `OEM_ID` /
   `OEM_TABLE_ID` / `OEM_REVISION` match and the override's revision is at
   least the installed one. Bumping the revision by 1 step is the standard
   trick to force the upgrade even when the patched and original tables would
   otherwise tie.
3. Recomputes the ACPI table checksum so the result loads cleanly.

The exact source-level change is in `reference/ssdt27.patch`:

```asl
             CreateWordField (SBGF, 0x17, INT1)
-            INT1 = GNUM (0x001A088A)
+            Method (_INI, 0, NotSerialized)
+            {
+                INT1 = GNUM (0x001A088A)
+            }
```

That is the *only* semantic change. Everything else (every other device,
every other field, every other method) is identical to the OEM SSDT.

---

## Re-deriving the patch on a similar laptop

If you have a different HONOR (or any other) machine where SSDT-load fails
with `AE_AML_INTERNAL`, the same approach should apply:

```bash
# 1. Capture live ACPI tables
sudo build/extract_oem_acpi.sh   # writes ./oem_acpi/*.dat + *.dsl

# 2. Find the SSDT named in the dmesg error line. dmesg will say
#    "(SSDT:<TABLE_ID>) while loading table". Open <TABLE_ID>.dsl and
#    look for a top-level statement that calls a method (anything that's
#    *not* inside a Method (...) {} block). Common culprits are
#    `<field> = <method>(<arg>)` lines inside Device(...) blocks.

# 3. Wrap that statement in `Method (_INI, 0, NotSerialized) { ... }` so
#    it runs after the table has loaded.

# 4. Recompile and bump the OEM revision (see build/build_patch.sh for the
#    exact one-liner).
```

The Windows-side dump under `win11_dump/` is invaluable here: `pnp_full_dump.txt`
shows the *actual* ACPI path and HID for every device, so you can confirm
which BIOS device you're chasing. For example, in our case Linux saw a
`TXNW3643:01` I²C device which turned out to be a MIPI camera template
*reused as a vendor PNP ID*, not the touchpad. The touchpad's real ACPI path
(`\_SB.PC00.I2C1.TPD0`) was only visible in the Windows PnP dump.

---

## Other bootloaders

`apply_patch.sh` writes the kernel cmdline edit to `/etc/default/limine`. If
you use another bootloader, do the same thing in its config:

- **systemd-boot**: edit the `options` line in your
  `/boot/loader/entries/*.conf` to include ` i8042.dumbkbd=1`.
- **GRUB**: append to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub`,
  then `sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
- **rEFInd**: append to the matching `options` line in `refind.conf`.

The ACPI override side (initramfs hook) is bootloader-agnostic — any setup
that produces an early uncompressed CPIO from `mkinitcpio` will work
(default for all Arch-likes). For non-`mkinitcpio` setups (Ubuntu/Debian
`initramfs-tools`, Fedora/Bazzite `dracut`), you need to use that tool's
equivalent of "early CPIO ACPI override" — see
`Documentation/admin-guide/acpi/initrd_table_override.rst` in the kernel
tree.
